  <meta property="og:description" content="The high concentration of ammonia from deteriorated aquaculture environments and the intensive culture system could increase the susceptibility to pathogens and even cause high mortality in Litopenaeus vannamei. In addition, we have revealed that the ammonia-tolerant shrimp also have high disease resistance in L. vannamei. In the present study, in order to identify SNP markers associated with tolerance to ammonia toxicity, we developed and characterized SNPs from our previous transcriptome sequencing data of ammonia-stressed and control groups, and a marker-trait association analysis was performed for marker-assisted selection (MAS) to increase production in L. vannamei. A total of 318,919 SNPs were identified from the transcriptome sequences, and 25,772 SNPs were found from the 1826 ammonia-responsive genes with functional annotation. We selected 49 SNPs from 26 ammonia-responsive genes that had strong homologies to known genes in the shrimp and probably involved in immune function as candidate markers for genotyping, among which 39 SNPs were polymorphic for further marker-trait association analysis with the ammonia-tolerant (AT) and ammonia-sensitive (AS) groups. Finally, 12 out of the 49 SNP markers were identified to be associated with ammonia tolerance, containing 10 loci with significantly different allele frequencies and 10 loci with significantly different genotyping frequencies between the AT and AS groups. Among the associated markers, the G allele of TSP-1 (the first locus from the thrombospondin gene), the A allele of TSP-3, and the C allele of XBP1-5 (the fifth locus from X-box binding protein 1) only presented in the AT groups, but they were absent from the AS groups, which would be the preference of the MAS for the ammonia-tolerant shrimp. In addition, when the 12 associated SNP markers were used for analysis, the genetic diversity of the AT groups were significantly higher than that of the AS groups, but when the 39 loci were used there was no difference. This is the first report for the markers associated with ammonia tolerance in this species, indirectly with disease resistance, which provided important potential for genetic selection to increase survival rate and production in shrimp farming.">

<p>abstract = &ldquo;Background: Residual feed intake (RFI) was investigated as a measure of feed efficiency in a breeding population of Litopenaeus vannamei. Shrimp from 34 families were housed individually and feed efficiency and growth traits were recorded during two successive growth periods. The objectives of this study were (1) to estimate the heritability of RFI and related traits, including feed efficiency ratio (FER), average daily gain (ADG) and daily feed intake (DFI), (2) to determine the relationships between RFI and other traits, and (3) to evaluate the variation of these traits across two growth periods. Results: Shrimp displayed large inter-individual variation in RFI, FER, ADG and DFI during each growth period. Heritability estimates of all these traits during both periods reached high values (0.577 ± 0.232 to 0.707 ± 0.252). RFI showed weak and no genetic correlations with ADG during the two growth periods between days 1 to 21 (0.135 ± 0.204) and 22 to 42 (–0.018 ± 0.128), respectively, but high positive genetic correlations with DFI (&gt;0.8). Weak and moderate negative genetic correlations were observed between RFI and FER during the two periods (–0.126 ± 0.208 and –0.387 ± 0.183). As evidenced by the high genetic correlations between the two periods for each trait (&gt;0.6), trait performance of the shrimp tended to be consistent across periods. Conclusions: For the first time, accurate measurement of individual feed efficiency on a large scale was achieved in shrimp. Although the estimated heritability reported here for RFI may be overestimated, it is a heritable trait in L. vannamei that can be improved by genetic improvement. For L. vannamei, the biggest potential advantage in using RFI as a measure of feed efficiency is that it is independent of growth rate, and thus genetic selection on RFI has the potential to improve feed efficiency and reduce feed intake, without compromising growth performance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>abstract = &ldquo;Background: Our aim was to estimate the genetic parameters for the direct genetic effect (DGE) and indirect genetic effects (IGE) on adult body weight in the Pacific white shrimp. IGE is the heritable effect of an individual on the trait values of its group mates. Methods: To examine IGE on body weight, 4725 shrimp from 105 tagged families were tested in multiple small test groups (MSTG). Each family was separated into three groups (15 shrimp per group) that were randomly assigned to 105 concrete tanks with shrimp from two other families. To estimate breeding values, one large test group (OLTG) in a 300 m2 circular concrete tank was used for the communal rearing of 8398 individuals from 105 families. Body weight was measured after a growth-test period of more than 200 days. Variance components for body weight in the MSTG programs were estimated using an animal model excluding or including IGE whereas variance components in the OLTG programs were estimated using a conventional animal model that included only DGE. The correlation of DGE between MSTG and OLTG programs was estimated by a two-trait animal model that included or excluded IGE. Results:  Heritability estimates for body weight from the conventional animal model in MSTG and OLTG programs were 0.26 ± 0.13 and 0.40 ± 0.06, respectively. The log likelihood ratio test revealed significant IGE on body weight. Total heritable variance was the sum of direct genetic variance (43.5 %), direct–indirect genetic covariance (2.1 %), and indirect genetic variance (54.4 %). It represented 73 % of the phenotypic variance and was more than two-fold greater than that (32 %) obtained by using a classical heritability model for body weight. Correlations of DGE on body weight between MSTG and OLTG programs were intermediate regardless of whether IGE were included or not in the model. Conclusions: Our results suggest that social interactions contributed to a large part of the heritable variation in body weight. Small and non-significant direct–indirect genetic correlations implied that neutral or slightly cooperative heritable interactions, rather than competition, were dominant in this population but this may be due to the low rearing density.&rdquo;</p>
